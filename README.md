# PyOceanStor
Python 3 library implementing a reduced subset of bindings for Huawei's OceanStor REST API

## Origins
This library was initially forked from [tcomerma/check_oceanstor](https://github.com/tcomerma/check_oceanstor) and then adapted to Python 3 and extended with more functionality

# Building
This has been hastily packaged into a module with no prior experience. Any help or suggestions are welcomed.

	$ python3 -m build

Then it can be installed locally:
	$ python3 -m pip install dist/pyoceanstor_upc-0.1-py3-none-any.whl

# Usage
	from pyoceanstor_upc import OceanStor
